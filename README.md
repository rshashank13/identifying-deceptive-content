### Summary:
The proliferation of fake news and clickbait articles on social media platforms has become a major concern for individuals, organizations, and society as a whole. In this article, we study the relationship between clickbait and fake news detection tasks by implementing state-of-the-art models for both of the tasks and studying their predictions on various datasets. Our findings suggest a positive correlation be tween models predicting fake news and clickbait. Training models with diverse data from multiple sources can enhance their adaptability and resilience by eliminating bias towards any specific source. Such diversity can render the model more versatile and robust.
